# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game App

## About the app

This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game app. 
After selecting an option (rock, paper or scissors), the player is forwarded to the score page, where after a short countdown the randomly chosen option for the house will be display.
After evaluating the options of the AI and the player, the final result of the game will be displayed, and according to that result, a point will be given (if the player won), taken (if the player has lost) or nothing happens at all (if it is a draw).
With the result, the player will have a button, which leads him back to the page, where he can select the options.
The design was used from [Frontend Mentor Challange](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbUV0bkJIZzhSQ0ZmeF81aHVXZ2lvM0tRR0E2Z3xBQ3Jtc0tsZW5ReTZZZjNwS29nVWc5OWdqVEFGSzd1SzlEVWZrQjZlcDdFOVNVcW0zSlJsVjdET1NudHZSVnYxU1E5aGxROFNFMDZKM0g3VVVjeE5LN0kybjJQUG16dS1kZXVXRlJEVTNRTTZkRUhyX0sySWVNSQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.frontendmentor.io%2Fchallenges&v=tCSaSDgz2Hw)

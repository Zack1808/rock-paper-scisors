## Description

This is a simple and interactive React based Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows the user to play the game against the computer. The game aims to be fun and engaging and also tries to test the users decision-making skills and luck.

## Features

- User selection: the game allows the user to select one of the three signs used for rock-paper-scissors.
- Random AI: the computer uses a randomizing function, randomly selecting on of the signs from the list.
- Score tracking: the users score will increase by one for each victory, and will decreas by 1 for each loss. Should the game be a tie, no points are scored.
- Rule display: the user can check the rules of the game, which will display which sign beats which.
- Responsive design for seamless gameplay on different devices.
